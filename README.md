iOS app to track EASA-FCL (and futurely FAA) Recency requirements

This is a small iOS app, built totally in Swift, to help professional pilots keep track of their compliance to the recent experience rules by the European aviation authorities (EASA) and futurely the American ones (FAA).

Currently only one aircraft type is supported.
