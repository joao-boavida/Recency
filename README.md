# Recency
iOS app to track EASA-FCL Recency requirements

This is a small iOS app, built totally in Swift, to help professional pilots keep track of their compliance to the recent experience rules by the European aviation authorities (EASA) and the American ones (FAA).

Currently flying only one aircraft type is supported, as it is what the majority of professional pilots does.
